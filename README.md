# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Technical designer at IO Interactive, working on Project 007. ðŸŽ® I'm 22 and currently live in Denmark. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°

## What do I like ðŸŽ¸
Playing guitar, GNU/Linux, OS kernels, game development, building tools, scripting, APIs, and hacking different technologies together to make a nuclear disaster of a system somehow work

## Why is this kinda empty?
I primarily use my own Git instance for version control. Most of my repositories on GitHub and my Git instance are private, but feel free to reach out to me if you're curious about anything.
