## Stuff I like 🎸
Playing guitar, GNU/Linux, OS kernels, tools, scripting, APIs, display drivers, and hacking different technologies together to make a nuclear disaster of a system somehow work

## Why is this kinda empty?

I primarily use my own Git instance for version control. Most of my repositories on GitHub and my Git instance are private, but if you're interested in any specific project, feel free to reach out to me.
